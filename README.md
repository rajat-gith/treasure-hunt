<h2>Treasure Hunt App</h2>

The webapp is meant to identify and measure the softskill of the user interacting with the webapp.
It has two main utillizations:
1. To measure the softskills
2. Admin Site: To have a clear overview of all the users interacting with the game.

The treasure hunt game has different stages.
At each stage you will be given a clue and intermediate stages have some puzzles in it.
You have to gather all the clues and reach to a final conclusion.

<h2>Brief Logic</h2>
The challenge consists of multiple stages that test the user's memory and problem-solving skills.<br/>
In Stage 1, the user is given a clue for 10 seconds, after which they need to solve a challenge.<br/>
In Stage 2, the user needs to solve another challenge, and the time taken to do so tests their accuracy.<br/>
In Stage 3, the user is given another clue for 10 seconds, after which they must choose the correct option to proceed.<br/>
The correct option can only be deduced if the user has correctly deduced both clues in Stages 1 and 3.<br/>
Subsequent stages also have clues embedded in them that the user must connect to reach the final result.<br/>
Stage 3 and Stage 4 are dead ends, and choosing an incorrect option will result in the challenge ending.<br/>
The challenge is designed to test the user's memory power and grasping power by presenting clues for a limited time and requiring them to solve puzzles.<br/>


Future Updates:
1. Addition of more complication puzzles and riddles to test more accurately
